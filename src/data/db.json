The markets are open every day, and sit among a heritage listed rainforest, making the setting just as impressive as the market itself. Stop in at the Frog’s Restaurant for a coffee, before heading to the Dome Climb to get an incredible view of the city.When you are ready to cool down, take a swim at Cairns Lagoon which is located on the Esplanade in the city. Pick up some food, and enjoy using the BBQ facilities on site for lunch. If seeing a Cairns beach is on your list, take the campervan out to Palm Cove which boasts ice cream parlours and cafes."
